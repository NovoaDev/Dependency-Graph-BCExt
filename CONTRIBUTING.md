## How to contribute
In case you want to contribute code to this project, you must first establish what type of contribution it is and create an issue according to its type:

### A small bug fix. üêõ
In this case the review will be lighter, only the functionality will be tested and tests will be added or modified if necessary.

### New capabilities or major change implementations. ü•á
The process will be slower.
- There should be a prior conversation about the functionality you want to implement, either through [discussions](https://github.com/NovoaDev/Dependency-Graph-BCExt/discussions). or within an issue. The point of this is that you don't waste time writing code, which then may not be accepted.
- Fork the repository.
- Create a Pull Request with the changes. 
- The next step is to wait for the approval of the PR, it will be evaluated and approved or rejected.

Feel free to contact any of the maintainers if you have any questions about the contribution process.
